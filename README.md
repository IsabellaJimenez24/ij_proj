# Abstract: For my project I wanted to compare two different sources on agricultural waste and the ways they both implement sustainable byproducts. I wanted to focus on a bigger topic such as agricultural waste since it does have a great impact on society as we are only privy to what type of information is public and available to us. By looking over both texts there are noticeably some overlap in information with how they choose to process and repurpose wasted argricultural products. My dataset will showcase the different patterns and influence that each piece of texts represents. This dataset should provide valuable insight as to the uncovering of various trends with combinations of words such as agriculture and agro-waste. So as my two sources come from different authors, there is a reocurring extension of gathered texts that demonstrate in more or less the same development of research through their terminology.
