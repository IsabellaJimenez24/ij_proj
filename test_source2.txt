Abstract: The agricultural sector generates a significant amount of waste, the majority of which is not productively used and is becoming a danger to both world health and the environment. Because of the promising relevance of agro-residues in the agri-food-pharma sectors, various bioproducts and novel biologically active molecules are produced through valorization techniques. Valorization of agro-wastes involves physical, chemical, and biological, including green, pretreatment methods. Bioactives and bioproducts development from agro-wastes has been widely researched in recent years. Nanocapsules are now used to increase the efficacy of bioactive molecules in food applications. This review addresses various agri-waste valorization methods, value-added bioproducts, the recovery of bioactive compounds, and their uses. Moreover, it also covers the present status of bioactive micro- and nanoencapsulation strategies and their applications.\
Keywords: agro-waste; valorization; value-added bioproducts; bioactive compounds; micro/nano encapsulation; agri-food-pharma applications\
1. Introduction\
The disposal of agricultural waste is one of the major environmental issues, which poses adverse effects on ecosystems due to the careless dumping of agricultural waste into the environment. Most reports say that untreated and underutilized agro-industrial waste is disposed of by burning, dumping, or placing it in a landfill [1,2]. Untreated garbage contributes to several greenhouse gas emissions, which in turn exacerbate climate change in a variety of ways. In addition to negative effects on the climate, this also results in the release of additional, undesirable gaseous byproducts [3]. Therefore, significant interventions are required for the sustainable use of agro-waste. This can take the form of the development of sustainable energy technologies and the creation of value-added bioproducts. A larger strain on the environment has resulted from increased global output of wastes, with detrimental effects on soil, air, and water resources [4], which in turn threaten the health of populations and the long-term viability of ecosystems. About 21\'9637% of greenhouse gases are produced by the agricultural sector [5]. This new reality has prompted a model of sustainable development in recent years that calls for substantial shifts in conventional agricultural production methods and waste utilization.\
High concentrations of complex carbohydrates, proteins, fibers, polyphenolic compo- nents, bioactive compounds, etc., are found in agro-wastes [6]. Despite the fact that organic\

 compound wastes pose a threat to the environment, they could be used as a raw material in a wide range of agricultural, food, and pharmaceutical goods [7]. The agro-residues are not considered a waste because of their high nutrient content; rather, they are used as a source material for new products. Effective pretreatment technologies for agro-waste biomass, its biochemical characteristics, and advanced conversion processes can improve the cost-effectiveness of conversion processes for bioproducts development [8]. Microbial biotechnology and nanotechnology play a pivotal role in the bioconversion of agricultural waste into enzymes and other bioactive compounds in the pharmaceutical sector, vermi- compost, organic fertilizers, and biofuels in the agriculture sector, and nutraceuticals and food products [9\'9613]. Due to its many potential applications, nanotechnology is increas- ingly being explored in the food and healthcare industries. Due to the aforementioned enhancements in bioavailability and levels of bioactive compounds, the capability for guided administration of bioactive compounds to specific tissues or organs is also boosted. Nanostructured materials have the potential to revolutionize the food business because of their unique features and large surface area. While the potential benefits of nanotechnology to society as a whole have been widely recognized, recently, the field of food science has begun to explore its applications [14]. Using a matrix or inert material, nanoencapsulation is a method for keeping coated substances (food or flavor molecules/ingredients) that are in a liquid, solid, or gaseous form. Stabilizing bioactive compounds via nanoencapsulation allows for more precise control over their release at physiologically active locations [15]. Therefore, this review addresses the valorization of agro-waste into value-added bioprod- ucts, bioactive compounds, and their applications in the agri-energy-pharma sector, along with the present status of bioactive micro/nanoencapsulation strategies and their applica- tions, with the ultimate goal of reducing waste for a sustainable and green environment. In this review, we retrieved 93 articles on agriculture waste, valorization, pretreatment meth- ods, value-added products, and micro- and nanoencapsulation from the Web of ScienceTM Core Collection.\
2. Availability of Agro-Waste\
There are various sorts of agro-waste in the environment, depending on their origin and availability [16]. Agro-waste consists primarily of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. Due to their structural complexity, lignocelluloses are difficult to break [17]. Various types of wastes, including crop residue, aquaculture waste, and other wastes of agricultural origin, have been reported [18,19]. The two largest available categories of waste are crop residue and agro-industrial waste, both of which are produced in huge quantities every day in the agricultural and food processing industries [20]. On the other hand, the absence of appropriate management techniques for these wastes, which may be traced back to a lack of or limited access to adequate information, has steadily become a significant obstacle that cannot be minimized due to its magnitude.\
Because the manure from cattle is a major source of noxious gases, harmful mi- croorganisms, and odor, there is cause for concern regarding both public health and the environment [21]. Unconsumed feed and undigested substances, both of which are ex- pelled from fish as waste in the form of feces, are the two main contributors to aquaculture solid waste [22]. The possibility for contamination of both surface water and groundwater exists if there is an excessive application of a mixture, an incorrect disposal of agro-residue, undiluted chemicals, or even pesticide containers. Utilizing farm waste in a managed manner can improve irrigation and erosion management [23]. The distinction between agricultural residue and other solid fuels, such as charcoal, wood, and charcoal briquettes, is based on their availability and distinguishable qualities.\

Agro-waste cannot be utilized without a proper pretreatment since modified agro- waste is more effective and useful [24]. Agricultural waste undergoes multiple treatment procedures prior to being utilized. Residues of agro-waste are made of lignocellulosic mate-\

 organic waste during the vermicomposting process. Vermicomposting is a low-cost and environmentally friendly method for dealing with agricultural waste. One of the most prevalent earthworm species utilized in vermicomposting is Eisenia foetida [57]. Results from physicochemical analyses have indicated that, in comparison to compost and other agricultural wastes, vermicomposting reduces total organic carbon (TOC) and the carbon\'96 nitrogen (C/N) ratio while increasing nitrogen\'96phosphorus\'96potassium (NPK) content [58]. Additionally, it can be used to increase agricultural yields by eliminating harmful organisms in the environment (biocontrol), enhancing soil water retention, and manufacturing plant growth regulators. In an effort to revitalize depleted soils, Roohi et al. [59] fertilized maize with either bacteria or compost, or with both. Compost was found to increase both microbial activity and diversity in degraded irrigated soils. Das and Deka [60] demonstrated that nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium concentrations in compost made from cow dung using E. fetida were significantly higher than in compost made from other types of waste. In addition, studies have found that certain species of earthworms secrete the decomposition- promoting phosphatase enzyme [61]. Therefore, vermicomposting can function as a tool for environmental conservation.\
5.1.2. Biofertilizers\
Soil biofertilizers, which can be made from microorganisms such as bacteria, cyanobac- teria, fungi, and algae, are defined as those that improve soil quality by adding nutrients and carbon substrates. Green manures such as cyanobacterial supplements and bioformu- lations of bacteria such as Azotobacter sp., Azospirillum sp., Trichoderma sp., and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (AMF) are the most prevalent and widely used biofertilizers. In ad- dition to microbial \'93biofertilizers\'94, farmers frequently employ organic-based fertilizers, including vermicomposting residues, crop residues, and farmyard manure [62,63]. Efforts have been made to develop biofertilizers from agri-waste in the form of discarded melons, pineapples, oranges, bananas, and papayas. Biofertilizer was made using a solid-state fermentation technique and then employed in a vegetable garden. The physical prop- erties of plant samples treated with biofertilizer made from watermelon, papaya, and banana wastes were positively represented in the experimental results. The maximum potassium concentration was found in the banana biofertilizer [64]. Composting and anaerobic digestion (AD) are the two major processes that make use of the metabolic capa- bilities of the thermophilic and decomposer microbial populations [65]. Enzymes found in native microbial communities aid in bioprocesses for the production of biofertilizers from agro-wastes.\
5.1.3. Bioenergy (Biofuels)\
Fuels made from renewable organic biomass, or biofuels, are considered a way to lessen reliance on fossil fuels, lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, particularly from the transportation sector, and increase fuel supply security. Biofuel production from lignocel- lulosic materials and other wastes is reported by several researchers [10\'9613,66]. Enzymes are used to separate monosaccharides from polysaccharides after physicochemical prepa- ration. Enzymes that break down cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin are required for maximizing sugar monomer release. It has been noted that thermochemical pretreatment releases oligosaccharides that are not digestible by most of the relevant fermentation organ- isms [13,67]. The use of lignocellulose-derived sugars in ethanol synthesis has received the greatest attention.\
Ethanol can be efficiently produced from glucose and other hexoses by using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is the most widely used organism for ethanol pro- duction. Brettanomyces bruxellensis and Zymomonas mobilis are yeasts and bacteria, respectively, that can produce ethanol in industrial settings. For example, B. bruxel- lensis has been proven to ferment oat straw hydrolysate to ethanol [68]. When using straw for biofuels, methane (biogas) production is an additional choice. Energy efficiency, greenhouse gas emissions, and biomass conversion are all improved when switching\

 to the generation of tetracycline, peanut shells proved to be the most productive sub- strate at 4.36 mg/g, followed by corncobs. The production of antibiotics was made far more affordable by the utilization of low-cost carbon sources derived from a wide va- riety of agricultural waste. These residues present an excellent opportunity for inno- vation in the manufacturing of neomycin and various other antibiotics. In the study conducted by Vastrad and Neelagund [74], the synthesis of extracellular rifamycin B was studied through the use of solid-state fermentation with oil-pressed cake, which is regarded as an agro-industrial waste. An investigation was made into the process of solid-state fermentation used by Streptomyces speibonae OXS1 to create oxytetracycline from cocoyam peels, which are considered to be household kitchen wastes of agricultural output [75].\
5.3.2. Antioxidant Properties\
Antioxidant and anticancer drugs were also developed using agro-waste as a sub- strate. The remains of various fruits and vegetables, such as fruit and vegetable peels, are usually referred to as waste or useless. Duda-Chodak and Tarko [76] studied the antioxidant capabilities of fruit seeds and peels. In their investigation, they discov- ered that the peels of selected fruits have the highest antioxidant activity and polyphe- nol concentration. Pomegranate byproducts from farming produce copious amounts of garbage. It contains ellagitannins, punicalagin, and punicalin, which are extremely powerful antioxidants [77]. Based on their broad range of bioactivities, natural products are often viewed as promising candidates for further value-added research. Phenolic chemicals play a particularly important role among them because of the widespread knowledge of their positive effects on human health, including their function in can- cer and cardiovascular disease prevention [78]. Their ability to operate as powerful antioxidants, which are produced in oxidative stress situations and are responsible for the start of a number of inflammatory and degenerative disorders, has been linked to these effects.\
5.3.3. Antibacterial and Anticancer Properties\
Waste from the agriculture and food industries has the potential to boost the body\'92s absorption of a wide variety of pharmaceuticals. These are a fantastic resource for a variety of essential nutrients as well as phytochemical substances that can help contribute to a balanced diet. They are a good source of organic and inorganic compounds, sugars, and many phenolic compounds. These phenolic compounds have therapeutic applications due to their anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, immunomodulatory, and antifungal properties. Additionally, they have antibacterial potential due to the production of many antibiotics by microbes produced through agricultural waste. Numerous studies have been conducted on the bioactive compounds found in agricultural residues [49,53]. From the results of orange and lemon processing, millions of tons of waste are generated annually from the industrial manufacture of orange and lemon juice, and this waste is a rich source of hydroxycinnamic acids and flavonoids, primarily flavanone glycosides, flavanones, and flavone aglycons [79]. As byproducts of potatoes, there is little doubt that potato peels are one of the most widely available vegetable waste products. There are a number of potential uses for their extracts, including in the food industry. Chlorogenic acid is the most abundant phenolic acid in peels [80]. Byproducts of lignocellulosic agriculture, such as wheat straw residues, wheat and rice bran, spent residues of coffee ground nuts, and sawdust, have been widely described as a clean source of phenolic compounds and have the potential to be utilized for application in a variety of industries due to the antioxidant and antimicrobial properties that they possess [79].\
6. Bioactives from Agro Waste: Micro/Nano Formulation and Food Application\
The main difference between microencapsulation and nanoencapsulation is the par- ticle size, which normally ranges from 1 micrometer (m) to 1 mm (mm), and the length\
\
Bioengineering 2023, 10, 152\

 of time microencapsulation has been deployed [81]. Microencapsulation has been imple- mented in nearly all industrial sectors, from agriculture and the environment to house- hold and personal care products [82]. Many nanoencapsulated and microencapsulated technologies rely on particle size and distribution homogeneity to be effective. The use of supercritical carbon dioxide (CO2) has demonstrated promising advantages for en- suring the proper design of particle size in both microencapsulated and nanoencapsu- lated pharmaceuticals, as well as the capacity to manage drug-loading procedures across a variety of temperature, pressure, and flow ratios [83]. As noted previously, one of the most alluring features of nanoencapsulation is its capacity to prevent the degrada- tion of active pharmaceutical ingredients. Nanoencapsulation has also enhanced the accuracy of medication delivery targets by coating or conjugating the surface to en- able proper cell entrance [84]. In addition, nanoencapsulated pharmaceuticals can be labeled with fluorescent probes for imaging, which is particularly important for assess- ing therapeutic efficacy during preclinical and clinical research. In the agriculture sec- tor, nanofertilizers are advantageous for nutrition management due to their high poten- tial for enhancing nutrient utilization efficiency. Alone or in combination, nutrients are bonded to nanodimensional adsorbents, which release nutrients much more slowly than conventional fertilizers.\
There are a number of conventional techniques for microencapsulating food com- ponents; however, no single technique is compatible with the core materials or product applications. As previously indicated, the process of microencapsulation is governed by the application and factors such as the target particle size, physicochemical properties of the external and interior phases, release mechanisms, total cost, etc. [85]. As the encapsulated chemicals are often in liquid form, drying techniques are commonly used to convert the liquid phase into a stable powder. To encapsulate active agents of food ingredients and nu- traceuticals, various techniques are available [86]. Numerous BACs and other hydrophobic or poorly water-soluble nutrients are crucial for human nutrition and the maintenance of consumer health and wellbeing. Incorporating these compounds into the pharmaceutical and food sectors necessitated overcoming their poor solubility and bioavailability [15]. Nanoencapsulation is a promising strategy for protecting various food elements from certain physiological conditions or deterioration while also disguising some disagreeable aromas and flavors. Reducing the particle size of BACs could improve their stability, bioavailability, solubility, and delivery, hence enhancing their functional activity [87]. In addition, nanoencapsulation can regulate the release of active compounds and improve the final food product\'92s qualities. Nanocapsulated bioactives and their advantages are presented in Figure 5.\
Advances in nanotechnology have been made in the food science and industry re- cently. When it comes to protecting the public\'92s health and enhancing the functional qualities of food formulations, nanoencapsulation is still one of the most promising options. Thus, new methods for encasing bioactive compounds are constantly being introduced, each with their own set of benefits and drawbacks [15]. By using nanoencapsulation, food scientists and engineers can create protective shields that can withstand harsh envi- ronments, hide off-putting flavors and odors, and improve nutrient absorption, release, and delivery while also increasing the solubility of lipophilic bioactive substances in water [88]. There is a high probability of overlap between the many uses of nanoencapsu- lation methods. Therefore, features such as release patterns, safety and toxicity concerns, and economic considerations are taken into account when selecting a nanocarrier for the bioactive molecule.\

7. Future Prospective and Limitations\
Agricultural residues are a potential resource for the synthesis of high-value com- pounds. In the future, biotechnological methods will be utilized to extract high-value bioproducts from agricultural waste. Because of their low energy requirements and low cost, integrated nano- and biotechnological techniques are preferred for industrial waste valorization. Furthermore, biotechnological methods for agricultural waste valorization are viable solutions for developing unique bioproducts for a variety of industries [54]. There- fore, it is necessary to design eco-friendly and cost-effective cascade conversion techniques. Agricultural waste is seen as a nutritional and functional raw resource that can be utilized in numerous applications, making it a viable solution to economic and environmental issues [89,90]. They can be employed directly as protein, fat, vitamin, fiber, carbohydrate, mineral, and antioxidant dietary components. Other biomolecules from agricultural waste can be recovered physically or chemically and employed as nutritional and functional components. In order to preserve the physicochemical and microbiological stability of bioproducts during the valorization of these agricultural wastes, the unitary drying process is required to prevent microbial hazards [91]. Therefore, governments should promote the installation of infrastructure and technology that enables the use of agricultural leftovers and trash in production and storage regions. The elimination of other dangers, such as poisonous substances and antinutritional factors, must also be considered [92]. Thus, such unique and worthwhile technical implementation may be helpful in addressing such prob-\

lems across all sectors of agro-waste usage. A well-managed supply chain, supported by analysis, can also help in the disposal of agricultural waste. Agro-industrial food waste can be a useful low-cost feedstock for sustainable production of industrial products [93]. Thus, an appropriate green technology is required for bioproducts development. Moreover, the difficulties of economics and market resistance are reduced over time through effective policies and assessments of their execution.\
8. Conclusions\
Together, environmental policy and the growing demand for a wide variety of biobased products have led to a shift toward a greater focus on finding new uses for agricultural byproducts. Wastes from the food and agriculture industries are rich sources of both nutri- ents and bioactive compounds. It is more accurate to refer to these materials as \'93feedstock\'94 rather than \'93waste\'94 when addressing their possible use in the development of bioprod- ucts due to the fact that their composition might vary, including the presence of sugars, minerals, and proteins. The analysis presented here focuses mostly on agricultural waste, which was valorized in a number of ways to produce value-added products. Valorization through biotechnological and green approaches are helpful in bioproducts development in a cost-effective and comprehensive way. In order to establish a safe and green envi- ronment, it is beneficial to recycle wastes from the agricultural and agro-based sectors and use them as feedstock for development of various value-added molecules. Besides these, nanomaterials-based technology can also be used to increase bioactive compounds applicability in various industrial sectors.\
